Step 1: init git repo and being ability to find the repo root.
        .git dir with following objects
        ├── branches
        ├── config
        ├── description
        ├── head
        ├── objects
        └── refs
            ├── head
            └── tags

Step 2: writing to the objects inside the git repo.
    git hash-object -> converts filt to git object
    git cat-file prints it
    But what is this object?
        - content influences the name as it's hash is created using the content.
    Git is content-addressed file system
    the path of objects is calculated using sha-1 hash
    first two chars -> dor for the file 
    objets is stored like
    [type header] [size of object ascii digit]
